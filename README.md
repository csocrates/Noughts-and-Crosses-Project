# Noughts-and-Crosses-Project

This is a project that demonstrates my understanding of some of the fundamentals of C++.

These include importing libraries, varying data types, built-in and multi-dimensional arrays, for and while loops,  user input and recursion. 

Turns are alternated using a boolean. 

If a move is invalid (outside the columns/rows restrictions or an already occupied space), you will recieve an error message and be prompted to try again.

After every turn a check is made to determine if there is a winning combination or if the board is full.

In either of the above cases, you will recieve a message and be asked if you would like to play again. 

Run main.cpp and have a play!
